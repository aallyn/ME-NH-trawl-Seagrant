## Seagrant: Understanding climate impacts on the Maine coastal fish and invertebrate community through synthesis of the Maine-New Hampshire Inshore Trawl Survey

### Project Description

#### From the proposal:

> The overarching goal of this research is to synthesize data collected through the Maine-New Hampshire Inshore Trawl Survey to understand how climate change, fishing, and other environmental drivers are impacting key fish and invertebrate communities in coastal Maine waters.

### Objective 1

-   Analyze changes in biodiversity in space and time and evaluate associations with environmental factors and fishing
-   To be rerun with updated Maine DMR data

#### Analysis

-   biodiversity metrics/ maps
-   GAMMs

#### Data

-   Will double check that all necessary data is available in data folder

#### Scripts

-   See Ashley's code folder for scripts
-   pulled relevant scripts from original Seagrant directory

### Objective 2

-   Identify species groups and assess changes in habitat suitability if functional groups and communities in space and time

#### Analysis

-   removed shrimp and other unimportant invertebrates from top 50 species analysis
-   feeding guilds from [NOAA IEA definitions](https://noaa-edab.github.io/tech-doc/aggroups.html)
-   stratified mean for NMDS convergence and simplified plotting using [NOAA IEA procedure](https://noaa-edab.github.io/tech-doc/inshoresurvdat.html#data-analysis-29)
-   Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrix for NMDS and anosim/adonis

#### Data

-   raw data from [Maine DMR portal](https://mainedmr.shinyapps.io/MaineDMR_Trawl_Survey_Portal/) (MaineDMR_Trawl_Survey_Catch_Data_2021-05-14.csv)
-   old data (full-me-dmr-expcatch.csv)
-   species with feeding guild designation (species_groups.csv)
-   4 community matrices for top 50 species and functional groups (biomass and abundance) - output from ME_trawl_NMDS_species_7.21.R and ME_trawl_NMDS_groups_7.21.R saved for future use in Rmarkdowns or NMDS so you don't have to run beginning cleaning code

#### Scripts

-   set up with here function, so directory paths should work on any computer
-   Scripts located in code subfolder of objective 2 folder
-   Scripts that end in 7.21 are updated scripts from July 2021, the older versions are saved and have more versions of plots but are pretty messy
-   basic plotting that is not for NMDS in ME_trawl_plots.R
-   old script (ME_trawl_NMDS.R) went with the old data and trying out different NMDS plots
-   Pretty self explanatory anosim_adonis_analysis_7.21.R
-   NEFSC_NMDS_groups.R putting science center data into functional groups- not needed anymore
-   All Rmarkdowns in subfolder

### Objective 3

-   Analyze joint distribution of key predator-prey species within the community, with a particular focus on lobster and cod
-   contact Andrew Allyn ([aallyn\@gmri.org](mailto:aallyn@gmri.org)) for questions or code

### Objective 4

-   Evaluate how ecosystem changes align with shifts in diversity and composition of fishery landings over time in ports along Maine's coastline

#### Analysis
- Biodiversity metrics for landings data (by county and grouped into year)
- calculated with catch weight not abundance
- richness, shannon-weiner diversity, simpson's evenness, average taxonomic distinctness
- compare to new trawl biodiversity metrics calculated as fall and spring combined and with weight for most relevant comparison to landings metrics
- Functional groups defined for landings and plots based on NOAA IEA feeding guilds
- want to look at trawl region definitions for landings comparison next

#### Data

-   Landings data from [DMR portal](https://mainedmr.shinyapps.io/Landings_Portal/)
-   In data folder MaineDMR_Modern_Landings_Data_All.csv
-   County and species specific landings 2008-2020
-   2006-2007 data from Rob Watts excel sheet JerelleJesse_06-07_Non-ConfidentialSpeciesByCounty_8-20-2021
-   reformatted for csv MaineDMR_2006_2007_Landings.csv ([rob.watts\@maine.gov](mailto:rob.watts@maine.gov))

#### Scripts

- fishery_landings.Rmd for landings biodiversity and functional group plots
- biodiversity.Rmd for new trawl biodiversity metrics calculated for comparison
